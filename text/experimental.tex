\section{Experiments}
\subsection{General}
Chemicals were purchased primarily from Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Company and Acros, Belgium, and were used without further purification.
Triethylamine was purchased anhydrous.
TLC was carried out using glass plates pre-coated with silica gel (F254, Silicycle SiliPlate 60~\AA ). 
Visualisation was by UV light, and \ce{I2} staining, respectively.
Silica gel was purchased from Silicycle, and used for medium pressure chromatography (\enquote{flash}-chromatography).

\up{1}H and \up{13}C NMR spectra were recorded at the frequencies stated, using deuterated chloroform as internal standard ($\delta$ = 7.26~ppm for \up{1}H and $\delta$ = 77.0~ppm for \up{13}C NMR).
400 MHz spectra were recorded on a Bruker Advance 400 spectrometer.
All coupling constants were measured in Hertz.

All moisture sensitive reactions were carried out in flame-dried glassware using argon from standard BOC industrial cylinders, dried through an activated silica column. Diethyl ether for moisture-sensitive reactions was used freshly distilled over Na under argon atmosphere.
Concentrations of \nBu Li in hexane were determined by titration using diphenylacetic acid.

To a solution of 2-methyl-2-propanethiol (94~mL, 0.84~mol) in DMF (150~mL) was added small pieces of sodium (19.37~g, 0.84~mol) at 0~\degc. The mixture was allowed to reach ambient temperature and was stirred overnight. 1,2,4,5-Tetrachlorobenzene (30.3~g, 140.6~mmol) was added at once, and the resulting mixture was heated to 90~\degc.
As soon as the reaction mixture darkened and steam started to develop, the heating source was removed.
As soon as the exothermic reaction had finished, the mixture was heated to 120~\degc for 24~h. 
After being cooled to ambient temperature, the reaction mixture was poured over ice. The precipitate was removed by filtration, washed with water, and dried to give 30~g (49.5\%) of the product as an off-white powder.\\
