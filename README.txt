This is a LaTeX template for the 6-Months research report of the Sigurdsson group.

The template is structured as follows:
1. The main document is template.tex, which calls your content from the files in the text-folder. You might want to set this file as 'master' document in your LaTeX editor, so that you don't need to jump back to template.tex every time for compiling.

2. Put your references in the folder "references". You can call multiple .bib-files with adding \addbibresource{references/filename.bib} into template.tex below the other \addbibresource-commands

3. Save your figures and schemes into the according folders. This is just to allow you a better overview. You can use .jpg and .png files, however, I recommand .png for best results.
